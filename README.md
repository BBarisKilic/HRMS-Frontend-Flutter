# <p align="center">Human Resources Management System - UI</p>

An alternative UI for the [Human Resources Management System](https://github.com/BBarisKilic/Human-Resources-Management-System) that uses [Flutter Framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) and provides responsive user interfaces and functionality for Web, iOS, and Android. The project has been written solely in [Dart Language](https://dart.dev/).

The app, HR Manager, inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Excellent WebWorld](https://dribbble.com/shots/12579027-Best-HRMS-System/attachments/4184565?mode=media).

Icons that used in HR Manager designed by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/eucalyp" title="Eucalyp">Eucalyp</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a>

HR Manager follows the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern and uses the [GetX](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx) package for state management.
